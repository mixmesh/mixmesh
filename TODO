* Check how pre-population of buffers is done best, now broken in simualtor_serv.erl
* Start using reltool/servtator create releases with boot scripts and ez files etc

---

Possible input to new TODO (pseudo random order):

* What about the code I have added so far. What do we need to change in order to have a common best practice?
* Get ElGamal app ready, i.e. remove bugs, make it compatible with dialyzer, start using verify&sign, reencryption and padding.
* Iron out the box installation procedure of the box in detail
* Get the netlink service stable and let it call player_serv:update_neighbours/1
A) How to read/write public keys from PKI server?
  1) From a local only non-networking PKI server (as it is today)
  2) From a central SSL based PKI-server over the net
     (The box must use the phone's Internet connection. How?)
  3) From a PKI server introduced as a hidden service on Tor
     (The box must use the phone's Internet connection. How?)
* Nudge message box parameters. K and F? Message buffer size? What is the max message size?
* How should we import new keys into A1? An app? Mounted disk? How?
* Make players message buffers persistent
* Look into message fullness behaviour during message exchange
* Do not reconnect with a neighbour player until a certain amount of time has elapsed (even though a player reappears)
* Re-exchange messages with persistent neighbour players after a certain time

=== red line

* How do we handle DOS attacks?
* Wait until the message buffer is full until players start to exchange message (maybe just create dummy messages galore)
* Move the players private key out from *.conf files and PIN-encode it
* Add SSL to SMTP and POP3 servers
B) Support a hybrid encryption approach in order to support media streams
* Add resend/ack/seqnumber etc to better support B?
* Write bridge servers as hidden services on Tor to bridge traffic between different geograophic islans of Obscrete nets (jocke*nyc@gmail.com) (The box must use the phone's Internet connection. How?)
* Talk to a campus and ask them if we can install our boxes in their attics, say 20 boxes on KTH. A 500kr each.
